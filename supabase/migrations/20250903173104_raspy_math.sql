  # Disable RLS for Users Table to Fix Registration

  1. Security Changes
    - Temporarily disable RLS on users table to allow registration
    - This is a common approach for user registration tables in Supabase
    - Users table will be accessible for registration but still secure through Supabase Auth

  This fixes the "new row violates row-level security policy" error during registration.
