  # Drop and Recreate RLS Policies to Fix Registration

  1. Security Changes
    - Drop all existing policies that might conflict
    - Create new, simple policies that allow user registration
    - Fix infinite recursion by avoiding complex policy conditions
    - Maintain security while enabling registration flow

  This fixes the "policy already exists" and infinite recursion errors.
