  # Fix Infinite Recursion in RLS Policies

  1. Security Changes
    - Drop all existing RLS policies that cause infinite recursion
    - Create simple, non-recursive policies for user registration
    - Allow public read access for products and queries (as needed for marketplace)
    - Maintain security while fixing the recursion issue

  This fixes the "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation users" error.
